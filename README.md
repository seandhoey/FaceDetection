# FaceDetection

Website is hosted on Render for free. It can be very slow when first accessed.

The Website talks to a Server which handles requests for the Clarifai API, and a PostgreSQL database.

To try the website:
1. Register and make an account on the website.
2. Login with your new credentials.
3. Enter the URL of an image into the search bar.
     Sample: https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2MjMwNDA3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTA2NDY3NQ@@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg
4. Press the "Detect" button. The image will be displayed if it is valid. Boxes will be drawn around any faces in the image.
5. Every time you enter a valid image to detect, your "count" will increment.
6. Logout!
